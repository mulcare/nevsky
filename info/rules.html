<h2>
<a href="#1.0" id="1.0">1.0 INTRODUCTION</a>
</h2>

<p>
Nevsky is a board wargame about the storied clash between Latin 
Teutonic and Orthodox Russian powers on the 13th-Century Baltic 
frontier. It is the first volume in GMT Games' Levy &amp; Campaign 
Series portraying medieval military operations. Players will raise 
and equip their armies and then send them out to ravage or conquer 
enemy territory and to defeat enemy forces in battle. Feudal obligations and alliances will provide a panoply of lords and vassals to 
serve on campaign&mdash;but only for limited periods. Players must keep 
an eye on the calendar and reward lords to keep them in the field.

<p>
An advanced rule adds detail regarding vassal forces' length of 
service. Players may use optional screens that hide the strength of 
their lords for greater fog of war. Though Nevsky has no solitaire 
system, the standard game is solitaire friendly.

<p>
A foldout play aid summarizes key game functions. Reference 
sheets list the lords and event/capability cards. The last few pages 
of this rule book provide scenarios and key terms. A background 
booklet has supplemental material such as examples of play.

<h3>
<a href="#1.1" id="1.1">1.1 General Course of Play</a>
</h3>

<p>
In Nevsky, two players take the roles of Russians (white) and 
Teutons (black), respectively. The Russians represent the wealthy 
city-state of Novgorod and its allies. The Teutons comprise German 
and other landholders&mdash;including the Teutonic Order&mdash;expanding 
a Baltic dominion. 

<p>
In turns covering 40 days (a traditional period of feudal obligation), 
Teutonic and Russian players will levy lords and vassal forces, 
gather transport, and recruit capabilities. Each lord's forces and 
assets are laid out on a mat. The players then plan and command 
a campaign for that 40 days with the lords who have mustered. 
A cylinder on the map represents each lord, while markers on a 
calendar show how much time remains in the lords' service, which 
can be influenced by hunger, pay, and success or failure in their 
campaigns.

<h4>
<a href="#1.3.1" id="1.3.1">1.3.1 Map</a>
</h4>

<p>
The game board shows a map of the Baltic frontier, 
circa 1240.  It depicts Locales linked by Ways, a Calendar along the 
top, and a Novgorod Veche (council of nobles) box in one corner.

<p>
TERRITORY: The map is divided between Teutonic territory in 
the west ("Estonia" and "Livonia", bordered in gray) and Russian 
territory in the east ("Rus", bordered in red).
<i class="note">
NOTE: In the game, Danish Estonia and Crusader Livonia are both Teutonic territory.
</i>

<p>
LOCALES: Locales are the spaces on the map that hold Lord cylinders and game markers. Locales include Regions, Towns, Trade 
Routes, Forts, Castles, Bishoprics, Cities, and Novgorod.

<ul>

<li>
Conquerable: Framed Locale names&mdash;all except Regions 
and Towns&mdash;indicate places important enough to receive 
"Conquered" victory point (VP, <a href="#5.1">5.1</a>) markers when the enemy 
takes them. The borders on the frame show the VP value: one 
marker if a single border; two markers if City or Bishopric; three 
if Novgorod (see Strongholds on the foldout). If the original 
owner retakes a Locale, remove any Conquered markers.

<li>
Strongholds: Novgorod, Cities, Bishoprics, Castles, and Forts 
can host Lords Withdrawn inside them and can be Besieged and 
Stormed (<a href="#4.3.4">4.3.4</a>-.5, <a href="#4.5">4.5</a>). They show a Siege Capacity (1, 2, or 3)
that affects how many Lords they can host and other aspects 
of Siege and Storm (<a href="#4.5">4.5</a>).

</ul>

<p>
FRIENDLY: Muster (<a href="#3.4">3.4</a>), Pay with Loot (<a href="#3.2">3.2</a>), and a few other 
game actions require Friendly Locales. A Locale is either Friendly 
or not Friendly to a side; it is Friendly if and only if:

<ul>

<li> It is either in that side's territory (Estonia or Livonia for Teutons, 
Rus for Russians) or is a Conquered Stronghold in enemy 
territory, AND

<li> It is free of the other side's Lords, Unconquered Strongholds, 
and Conquered markers.

</ul>

<p>
A Locale may be Friendly to neither side.

<p class="note">
NOTE: This means that Siege Locales (<a href="#4.3.5">4.3.5</a>) are never Friendly, 
nor are any Regions, Towns, or Trade Routes in enemy territory&mdash;
even if occupied.

<p class="example">
EXAMPLES: Vod or Volkhov if empty are Friendly to the Russians 
because they are in Rus. Neva with a Conquered marker is Friendly 
to no one. Izborsk if Conquered by Teutons becomes Friendly to 
the Teutons only, until retaken by the Russians.

<p>
SEATS: Some Locales host certain Lords' Seats, as shown by the 
Lord's Coat of Arms there (<a href="#1.5.1">1.5.1</a>). Also:

<ul>

<li>
Pskov: The Russian City of Pskov is a Seat for Yaroslav 
(a Lord on the Teutonic side) while Conquered by the 
Teutons.

<li>
Archbishopric: Novgorod bears a cross symbol to show 
that it serves as an extra Seat for all Russian Lords when the 
Archbishopric Capability card is in play (<a href="#1.9.1">1.9.1</a>, <a href="#3.4.4">3.4.4</a>); this 
would mean Novgorod would count as two Seats for Aleksandr, 
Andrey, and Domash.

<li>
Commanderies: Strongholds with an Order symbol serve 
as extra Seats for certain Teutonic Lords if the 
ordensburgen Capability is in play.

</ul>

<p>
SEAPORTS: Locales with an anchor affect Supply (<a href="#4.6">4.6</a>) and Sail 
(<a href="#4.7.3">4.7.3</a>).

<p>
WAYS: Two types of Ways&mdash;Waterways and Trackways&mdash;link 
Locales to one another for March (<a href="#4.3">4.3</a>), Avoid Battle (<a href="#4.3.4">4.3.4</a>), Retreat 
(<a href="#4.4.3">4.4.3</a>), Supply (<a href="#4.6">4.6</a>), the <var>Raiders</var> Capability (<a href="#1.9.1">1.9.1</a>), and certain 
Events. Locales connected by either type of Way are adjacent. The 
type of Way affects which Transport types (<a href="#1.7.4">1.7.4</a>) can use it in a 
given Season (<a href="#2.2.1">2.2.1</a>).

<ul>

<li>
Waterway connections trace along rivers and along any shore of 
a lake.
<i class="note">
NOTE: The Baltic Sea is not a Waterway in the game, but Lords can cross it using a Sail action between Seaports (<a href="#4.7.3">4.7.3</a>).
</i>

<li>
Trackways are overland routes along trade arteries&mdash;portages, 
roads, and tracks.

</ul>

<p class="example">
EXAMPLES: A single Waterway links Narwia to Uzmen, another 
links Uzmen to Pskov, and another connects Novgorod, Rusa, and 
Shelon River. Gdov does not block the Waterway along the opposite lakeshore from Narwia to Uzmen. Trackways and Waterways 
are separate; it would take at least two moves to get from Narwia 
to Ugaunia, first to Uzmen or Dorpat by Waterway, then on to 
Ugaunia by Trackway.

<p>
ON MAP: The phrases "on the map" and "on map" refer to Lords or 
markers that are at Locales or, for markers, in the Veche box (<a href="#1.3.3">1.3.3</a>). 
<i class="example">
EXAMPLE: A Lord cylinder on the Calendar is NOT "on map".
</i>

<h4>
<a href="#1.3.2" id="1.3.2">1.3.2 Calendar</a>
</h4>

<p>
A Calendar on the board tracks time and victory 
scores (<a href="#2.2">2.2</a>). Cylinders there track when Lords are Ready for 
Muster; markers show when Lords (and, if using an advanced 
rule, Vassals) must Disband. It shows eight Seasons in two rows, 
Summer 1240 to Rasputitsa 1242, each Season divided into two 
40-Days boxes. It lists reminders about Command cards (<a href="#4.1">4.1</a>), 
usable Transport (<a href="#1.7.4">1.7.4</a>), the <var>Crusade</var> card (<a href="#3.4.2">3.4.2</a>), and exchanging 
Carts and Sleds (<a href="#4.9.3">4.9.3</a>). 

<aside class="note">
DESIGN NOTE: The Russian word rasputitsa means a muddy season hindering travel. Rasputitsa in the game portrays the great spring thaw (though autumn rains also brought mud). The game breaks the freeze into two Seasons, Early and Late Winter.
</aside>

<h4>
<a href="#1.3.3" id="1.3.3">1.3.3 Novgorod Veche Box</a>
</h4>

<p>
A box at one corner holds Coin and 
victory point markers of Novgorod's Veche (city council, <a href="#1.4.2">1.4.2</a>, <a href="#3.5.2">3.5.2</a>), representing the city-state's wealth and independence.

<h3>
<a href="#1.4" id="1.4">1.4 Higher Authorities</a>
</h3>

Each side in Nevsky has a civil or religious authority over the Lords 
who can Levy them and otherwise support their efforts. 

<h4>
<a href="#1.4.1" id="1.4.1">1.4.1 Papal Legate</a>
</h4>

<p>
The Teutons have a purple Legate pawn and 
<var>William of Modena</var> Capability card representing an emissary from 
the Pope to the rulers of the region. 

<ul>

<li>
The Legate is only in play while the <var>William of Modena</var> 
Capability (<a href="#1.9.1">1.9.1</a>, <a href="#3.4.4">3.4.4</a>) is in effect.

<li>
Teutons put the Legate pawn on the <var>William of Modena</var> card 
whenever they receive that Capability (<a href="#3.4.4">3.4.4</a>). During Call to 
Arms, they may place the pawn at any Bishopric (<a href="#3.5.1">3.5.1</a>).

<li>
The Legate may March (<a href="#4.3">4.3</a>) or Sail (<a href="#4.7.3">4.7.3</a>) with any Teutonic 
Lord.

</ul>

<p>
ENDANGERED: If the Legate is ever with a Teutonic Lord who 
Avoids Battle, Withdraws, or Retreats (<a href="#4.3.4">4.3.4</a>, <a href="#4.4.3">4.4.3</a>) or is in a Locale 
with any Russian Lord(s) and no Teutonic Lord, remove the pawn 
and discard the <var>William of Modena</var> card.

<p>
EFFECTS: The Legate once on map can move himself, provide the 
Teutons a Call to Arms Levy (<a href="#3.5.1">3.5.1</a>), or add to a Command Rating 
(<a href="#4.2">4.2</a>) on Campaign&mdash;often returning the pawn temporarily to the 
<var>William of Modena</var> Capability card.

<h4>
<a href="#1.4.2" id="1.4.2">1.4.2 Novgorod Veche</a>
</h4>

<p>
The Russians have a box on the map (<a href="#1.3.3">1.3.3</a>) 
representing Novgorod's Veche, the civil authority governing 
Novgorod.

<p>
EFFECTS: The Veche during Call to Arms (<a href="#3.5.2">3.5.2</a>) can help Muster 
Lords, give a Lord extra Levy actions, or obtain victory points by 
declining Aleksandr or Andrey.

<aside class="note">
DESIGN NOTE: Novgorod's nobles gathered as needed into a body (veche in Russian) to appoint officials including a prince (knyaz). Veche partisans guarded their interests and their independence from such a lord through their right to decline his service. 
</aside>

<p>
WASTAGE: The Veche box can hold at most eight Conquered (victory point) markers and eight Coin; any excess is lost.

<p>
CONQUERED: If the Teutons Conquer Novgorod (<a href="#4.5">4.5</a>), remove all Coin from the Veche box; if it was Sacked, add that Coin to Spoils (<a href="#4.5.2">4.5.2</a>).

<p class="note">
NOTE: The Novgorod Veche may continue its Call to Arms even while the Novgorod Locale is Conquered (<a href="#3.5">3.5</a>).

<h3>
<a href="#1.5" id="1.5">1.5 Lords and Vassals</a>
</h3>

<p>
Cylinders, Service markers, and 5"x5" mats track the status of Lords in Nevsky. Vassals tied to each Lord also have Service markers and add Forces.

<h4>
<a href="#1.5.1" id="1.5.1">1.5.1 Lords</a>
</h4>

<p>
Lords (six on each side) are the figures who carry 
out military preparations and operations&mdash;Levy and Campaign.

<p>
CYLINDERS: The game uses cylinders for each Lord to show his 
location or readiness to Muster. Andrey and Hermann use either of 
two cylinders each, depending on whether or not they are a Marshal 
(see below).  Any reference to location of a Lord means where his 
cylinder is&mdash;a map Locale, on the Calendar, or out of the game. A 
cylinder's sticker shows that Lord's Coat of Arms and Command 
Rating (<a href="#1.5.3">1.5.3</a>, <a href="#4.2">4.2</a>).

<aside class="note">
SETUP NOTE: Apply stickers from the small sheet provided onto the 14 cylinders, one sticker each, white sticker on white, black on black. 
</aside>

<p>
COATS OF ARMS: Each Lord has his own shield-shaped Coat 
of Arms that identifies his cylinder, mat, Vassals, card effects, and 
so on.

<p>
MARSHALS: Each side may have at most one Lord on the map 
who is a Marshal and better able to lead an army of several Lords 
together (<a href="#4.3.1">4.3.1</a>). Aleksandr for the Russians and Andreas for the 
Teutons are Marshals whenever they are on the map. Andrey and 
Hermann are Marshals only if the other Marshal on their side is 
not currently on the map. A ring on a Lord's cylinder shows that 
he is a Marshal.

<li>
When Marching (<a href="#4.3.1">4.3.1</a>), a Marshal may at the player's discretion 
bring along any or all of his side's Unbesieged Lords at his Locale 
with him.

<li>
A Marshal may not be designated as a Lieutenant or as a Lower 
Lord to a Lieutenant (<a href="#4.1.3">4.1.3</a>). 

</ul>

<p>
SERVICE MARKERS: Each Lord has a Service marker that shows 
his Coat of Arms, Service Rating (<a href="#1.5.3">1.5.3</a>), and (except for Aleksandr) 
Fealty roll. Each Vassal also has such a marker showing the Coat 
of Arms of the Vassal's Lord, Vassal Forces (<a href="#1.6">1.6</a>), and a Service 
Rating (<a href="#1.5.4">1.5.4</a>). A Mustered Lord's Service marker is placed on the 
Calendar and shifts among 40-Days boxes (<a href="#2.2.3">2.2.3</a>) to show how 
much longer that Lord's Service will last. Vassal markers stay on 
their Lord's Mat or&mdash;if playing with the Vassal Service advanced 
rule&mdash;similarly are placed and shift on the Calendar (<a href="#3.4.2">3.4.2</a>).

<p>
COMMAND CARDS: Each Lord has a set of three Command 
cards (<a href="#1.9.2">1.9.2</a>) that enable him to take actions on Campaign (<a href="#4.2">4.2</a>).

<p>
DISBANDED: Lords sometimes Disband (<a href="#3.3">3.3</a>). Disband, Battle 
(<a href="#4.4">4.4</a>), and Storm (<a href="#4.5.2">4.5.2</a>) can permanently remove Lords from play. 
Return a Disbanded or removed Lord's Forces and Assets from 
his Mat to their respective pools (<a href="#2.1.1">2.1.1</a>) and discard any "This 
Lord" Capabilities at his mat (<a href="#1.9.1">1.9.1</a>, <a href="#3.4.4">3.4.4</a>). If Disbanded but not 
permanently removed, his cylinder returns to the Calendar (<a href="#3.3">3.3</a>). 
If permanently removed, his cylinder, mat, and Service markers 
are out of the game. 

<h4>
<a href="#1.5.2" id="1.5.2">1.5.2 Lord Mats</a>
</h4>

<p>
Each Lord has a 5"x5" mat that shows his 
characteristics and holds his Forces, Vassals, and Assets. Keep a 
Lord's mat in an Unused Mats table area (<a href="#2.1.1">2.1.1</a>) unless Mustered or 
permanently removed from play. When a Lord is Mustered, move 
his mat to an area in front of that player; when in  Battle or Storm,

<h4>
Hidden Mats Option
</h4>

<p>
For fog of war, players may agree to 
hide their Mustered Lords' mats (and "This Lord" Capability 
cards, <a href="#1.9.1">1.9.1</a>, <a href="#3.4.4">3.4.4</a>) behind screens (<a href="#2.1.1">2.1.1</a>) except when in Battle 
or Storm (<a href="#4.4">4.4</a>, <a href="#4.5.2">4.5.2</a>).

<ul>

<li>
Players declare hidden Assets, Capabilities, and Forces only as 
needed to verify actions on the board, such as enough Transport 
for a March (<a href="#4.3">4.3</a>).

<li>
Capabilities affecting an entire side remain revealed per the 
usual rules (<a href="#3.4.4">3.4.4</a>).

</aside>

<p>
ITEMS ON MATS: When setting up a Lord at start (<a href="#2.1.2">2.1.2</a>, <a href="#6.0">6.0</a>) 
or as Mustered during Levy (<a href="#3.4.1">3.4.1</a>, <a href="#3.5">3.5</a>), place his initial Forces, 
Assets, and available Vassal Service markers onto his mat as noted 
above. As the Lord Levies his Vassals' Forces or obtains Assets, 
add those unit pieces and Asset markers to his mat (up to eight of 
each Asset type, <a href="#1.7.3">1.7.3</a>). 

<p>
MAT SECTIONS: The Lord's starting Forces upon Muster (<a href="#3.4.1">3.4.1</a>) 
are shown on the mat at the word Forces; those pieces and any 
Vassal's Forces and markers that the Lord Musters are placed in the 
Forces section of the mat.

<p class="note">
NOTE: Forces of Vassals do NOT start 
Mustered (<a href="#1.5.4">1.5.4</a>). Forces Routed in Battle or Storm (<a href="#4.4.2">4.4.2</a>, <a href="#4.5.2">4.5.2</a>) 
slide below a line into a Routed section. Starting Assets (<a href="#3.4.1">3.4.1</a>)

section that holds the Lord's Assets and Vassal Service markers the 
become or remain available.

<p>
RATINGS: A Lord's ratings (<a href="#1.5.3">1.5.3</a>) are found listed in a column

SHARING: Lords may use and spend Assets (<a href="#1.7">1.7</a>) to help one 
another if at the same Locale. They never Share Vassals, Forces, 
or This Lord Capabilities.

<h4>
<a href="#1.5.3" id="1.5.3">1.5.3 Ratings</a>
</h4>

<p>Lord mats list several ratings:

<ul>

<li>
Fealty: A die-roll range for that Lord's propensity to Muster 
when another Lord Levies him (<a href="#3.4.1">3.4.1</a>), shown as a die with 
the upper number of that range (such as four pips for 1-4). 
Aleksandr has no Fealty rating because no Lord may Levy him, 
only the Veche without a roll (<a href="#3.5.2">3.5.2</a>).

<li>
Service: The number of 40-Days boxes ahead of the 
current box that the Lord's Service marker or cylinder 
is placed upon Muster (<a href="#3.4.1">3.4.1</a>) or Disband (<a href="#3.3">3.3</a>), a numeral 
in a box symbol.

<li>
Lordship: The number of Levy actions that the Lord 
takes (<a href="#3.4">3.4</a>), a numeral in a shield symbol.

<li>
Command: The number of actions that the Lord can 
undertake each time his Command card is revealed during 
a Campaign (<a href="#4.2.1">4.2.1</a>), a numeral in a card symbol. This 
numeral is also on the Lord's cylinder piece and Command cards.

</ul>

<aside class="note">
DESIGN NOTE: Fealty shows a Lord's enthusiasm to fight, Service his obligation to this conflict, Lordship his wherewithal to mobilize for war, and Command his alacrity leading in the field.
</aside>

<h4>
<a href="#1.5.4" id="1.5.4">1.5.4 Vassals</a>
</h4>

<p>
Almost all Lords in Nevsky have Vassals (subordinate 
nobles) who provide their Lords with additional Forces. Like Lords, 
each Vassal has a Service marker and a Service Rating (the latter 
used only with an advanced rule, <a href="#3.4.2">3.4.2</a>). Vassals have fealty solely 
to a single Lord, as shown by the Coat of Arms on the Vassal's 
Service marker. A Lord's Vassals, including the number of them 
with the same composition of Forces, are shown on his mat in the 
Assets &amp; Vassals section, to simplify preparation of a mat when 
Mustering a Lord (<a href="#1.5.2">1.5.2</a>, <a href="#3.4.1">3.4.1</a>). Special Vassals become available 
only upon play of relevant Capabilities (<a href="#1.5.1">1.5.1</a>, <a href="#3.4.2">3.4.2</a>).

<aside class="important">
<b>Important&mdash;</b>At start of play and when a Lord is Levied to enter play, his Vassals' units are not placed in the Forces section of his mat - they are added only as the Lord Musters those Vassals (<a href="#3.4.2">3.4.2</a>).

<p>
Various items that Lords obtain and 
use&mdash;Transport, Provender (food and 
other supplies), Coin (money), and Loot 
(livestock and other booty)&mdash;are shown 
by 5/8th-inch counters placed on Lords' mats. 

<p class="note">
NOTE: Asset markers provided are not a limit on play (but see 
<a href="#1.7.3" id="1.7.3">1.7.3). In the unlikely case that markers run out, players may represent added Assets with coins or pieces from other games or by </a>

one Asset of that type per stacked marker.

<h4>

one such Asset each; "x2", "x3", and "x4" markers represent those 
amounts.  Coin in the Veche box (<a href="#1.3.3">1.3.3</a>) functions similarly.

<ul>

<li>
Boats and Ships are usable in Rasputitsa and Summer. Boats 
are usable on Waterways. Ships are usable at Seaports and, by 
Russians, at Novgorod for Supply (<a href="#4.6.3">4.6.3</a>).

REMINDER: The term 
Waterway includes rivers and lakeshores but not the Baltic Sea.

<li>
Only Sleds are usable in Winter, and Sleds are usable only in 
Winter. They can be used on all Ways.

<li>
Carts are usable only in Summer and only on Trackways.
Sleds and Carts automatically convert into the other type at the end 
of Summer and Late Winter, with losses (<a href="#4.9.3">4.9.3</a>). Unusable Transport 
otherwise remains with its Lord for future use.

<h3>
<a href="#1.9" id="1.9">1.9 Cards</a>
</h3>

<p>
The game has two types of cards: Arts of War cards with Events 
and Capabilities (below), and Command cards that give Lords 
Campaign actions.

<h4>
<a href="#1.9.1" id="1.9.1">1.9.1 Arts of War</a>
</h4>

<p>
Each side has its own deck of Arts of War cards. 
Each Arts of War card is divided into an upper Event section and 
lower Capability section. Only one of the two sections may be in 
effect at a time.

<p>
<img class="square" src="../cards.1x/aow_teutonic_09.jpg">
<img class="square" src="../cards.1x/aow_russian_15.jpg">
<br>
Event: <var>Hill</var> (fleeting, <a href="#3.1.3">3.1.3</a>)
<br>
Capability: <var>Archbishopric</var> (lasting, <a href="#3.4.4">3.4.4</a>)  

<p>
EVENTS: The upper Event section provides players immediate 
and/or temporary benefits or opportunities. Players draw two Arts 
of War cards for their Events at the outset of each Levy after the 
first (<a href="#3.1">3.1</a>).
<i class="note">
NOTE: For the use of Events, see <a href="#3.1.3">3.1.3</a>.
</i>

<p>
CAPABILITIES: Lower sections on the cards show Capabilities 
that players can get for longer-lasting benefits. These are either 
drawn randomly during initial Levy (<a href="#3.1">3.1</a>) or are selected by the 
player (<a href="#3.4.4">3.4.4</a>). Coats of Arms show which Lords may Levy and use 
the Capability. Some cards say "This Lord" and attach to individual 
Lords; a few of these are duplicates, and no Lord may have more 
than one of that Capability. Capabilities remain in effect unless 
discarded under certain conditions (Disbanding Lord <a href="#3.3">3.3</a>, Capability 
Discard <a href="#4.0">4.0</a>, Reset <a href="#4.9.5">4.9.5</a>).

<p>
PLAY NOTE: Since Events and Capabilities are on the same cards, the draw of an Event might delay Levy of that card's Capability; likewise, an Event on a Capability in play cannot be drawn (<a href="#3.1.3">3.1.3</a>, <a href="#3.4.4">3.4.4</a>).
</aside>

<p>
NO EVENT/NO CAPABILITY: Three cards in each Arts of War 
deck yield no effect if drawn (<a href="#3.1">3.1</a>).

<p>
CARD <mark>USE</mark>: Whenever text on a card contradicts 
these rules, card text takes precedence.
<mark>The player of an Event or owner of a Capability decides how to implement card text within what is specified.</mark>

<p>
<img class="square" src="../images/marker_castle_teutonic.png" align="right">
<img class="square" src="../images/marker_walls.a.png" align="right">

<p>
CAPABILITY MARKERS: 
Teutonic <var>Stonemasons</var> and 
Russian <var>Stone Kremlin</var> Capabilities enable that side to 
place Castle and Walls +1 markers, respectively, onto the map, no 
more than one per Locale. Castle markers change their Locale from 
Fort or Town into a Castle (<mark>removing Walls +1 and</mark>
leaving any other markers there), add 
to Victory, and can flip to enemy possession but not be removed. 
A Walls +1 marker adds to a Stronghold's protection against Storm 
and is removed if Sacked. Place a Sea Trade Blocked marker on 
Russian <var>Baltic</var> and <var>Black Sea Trade</var> Capability cards when the 
Teutons block the effect as noted on the card.

<h4>
<a href="#1.9.2" id="1.9.2">1.9.2 Command Cards</a>
</h4>

<p>
Each side has a set of three Command 
cards for each Lord and three Pass cards. Players build their Campaign Plan deck each Campaign by stacking Command cards of 
their Mustered Lords plus Pass cards as needed (<a href="#4.1">4.1</a>).

<p>
PASS CARDS: Each side has three Pass Command cards to fill 
out a Campaign Plan deck when too few Lords are Mustered to do 
so with their cards.

<h2>
<a href="#2.0" id="2.0">2.0 SETUP AND CALENDAR</a>
</h2>

<p>
This section explains the game's general sequence and use of the 
Calendar track.

Mats Option (<a href="#1.5.2">1.5.2</a>).

<p>
<img class="big" src="images/layout_no_mats.png">
<br>

<h3>
<a href="#2.1" id="2.1">2.1 Setup</a>
</h3>

<h4>
<a href="#2.1.1" id="2.1.1">2.1.1 Lay out</a>
</h4>

<p>
Seat players and set the game board between them. 
You will want enough table space on all sides of the board for 
mats, cards, and Forces and marker pools. See the 2-player layouts 
shown here and tips for solitaire play in the Background booklet.

<p>
MATS AND SERVICE MARKERS: Keep unused Lord mats, 
Service markers, and the Battle mat to one side (<a href="#1.5.1">1.5.1</a>-<a href="#1.5.2">1.5.2</a>, <a href="#4.4.1">4.4.1</a>).

<p>
POOLS: Keep all Forces pieces (the game's wooden bits other than 
Lord cylinders and Legate pawn) in a convenient place nearby. We 
suggest separate pools for Assets (Transport, Coin, Provender, and 
Loot, <a href="#1.7">1.7</a>) and for remaining markers (<a href="#1.8">1.8</a>) to speed play.

<p>
DECKS: Separate the playing cards into four decks&mdash;Russian and 
Teutonic Arts of War and Russian and Teutonic Command (<a href="#1.9">1.9</a>).

<p>
OTHER ITEMS: Give each player a play aid foldout. Keep Lord 
cylinders, Legate pawn, other reference sheets, the background 
booklet, and this rules book handy. If using the Hidden Mats option 
(<a href="#1.5.2">1.5.2</a>), each player gets one screen.

<h4>
<a href="#2.1.2" id="2.1.2">2.1.2 Scenarios</a>
</h4>

<p>
Choose a scenario (<a href="#6.0">6.0</a>). Agree on whether to use 
screens for Hidden Mats (<a href="#1.5.2">1.5.2</a>), advanced Vassal Service (<a href="#3.4.2">3.4.2</a>), 
and/or No Horseback Archery (<a href="#6.0">6.0</a>) options. Set up the situation 
and begin play with the first Levy (<a href="#3.0">3.0</a>).

<h3>
<a href="#2.2" id="2.2">2.2 Calendar </a>

The Calendar (<a href="#1.3.2">1.3.2</a>) tracks time and victory. 

<h4>
<a href="#2.2.1" id="2.2.1">2.2.1 Seasons</a>
</h4>

<p>
Each Scenario covers one or more Seasons&mdash;
Summer, Early Winter, Late Winter, and Rasputitsa. Each Season 
comprises two 40-Day periods. Each 40-Days period has a Levy 
sequence, then a Campaign sequence.

<ul>
<li>
Conduct each Levy and Campaign as detailed respectively in 
rules sections 3 and 4 below and summarized on the Sequence 
of Play foldout page. 
</ul>

<h4>
<a href="#2.2.2" id="2.2.2">2.2.2 Marking Time</a>
</h4>

<p>
<img class="round" src="../images/marker_levy.png" align="right">

<p>
The round Levy/Campaign 
marker tracks the progress of Seasons and the 40-Day Levy and Campaigns within each. Mark that it 
is Levy or Campaign by placing the marker with 
that side up in the appropriate Levy or Campaign 
circle in the current 40-Days box on the Calendar.

<h4>
<a href="#2.2.3" id="2.2.3">2.2.3 Marking Service</a>

<p>
Place and shift Service markers and Lord 
cylinders in the Calendar's 40 Days boxes as described under the 
Levy rules (<a href="#3.2">3.2</a>-<a href="#3.5">3.5</a>) or on Event cards (<a href="#1.9.1">1.9.1</a>, <a href="#3.1.3">3.1.3</a>). All instructions to shift right or left mean that number of 40-Days boxes. If 
a direction is not specified, the executing player chooses.
<i class="example">
EXAMPLE: "Shift 1 right" from box 8 means to box 9, "1 left" from 9 means to 8. 
</i>

<ul>

<li>
If a Service marker or Lord's cylinder would be placed or shifted 
below (left of) box 1 or beyond (right of) box 16, set the marker 
or cylinder just off the board on the corresponding side: ignore 
further shifts in that direction. The first shift back toward the 
Calendar places the marker into box 1 or box 16, respectively. 
<i class="note">
NOTE: This avoids some "end of the world" anomalies.
</i>

</ul>

<h4>
<a href="#2.2.4" id="2.2.4">2.2.4 Player Order</a>
</h4>

<p>
Unless noted otherwise, the Teutons go first 
and the Russians second in each step of Levy and Campaign.
<i class="example">
EXAMPLE: During Disband Beyond Service Limit step (<a href="#3.3.1">3.3.1</a>), the Teutonic player Disbands Lords, then the Russians do so.
</i>

<p>
EXCEPTIONS:

<ul>
<li>
Play of Command cards alternates, one Teutonic card, then one 
Russian card, then another Teutonic card, and so on (<a href="#4.2">4.2</a>).

<li>
The order of many steps in Battle, Siege, and Storm will depend 
on who is Active, Attacking, has Archery or Cavalry, and so on 
(<a href="#4.4">4.4</a>, <a href="#4.5.2">4.5.2</a>).

<p>
The Calendar's numbered 40-Days boxes also serve to track victory scores (<a href="#5.1">5.1</a>), using round 
Victory markers. Place each side's Victory marker (on the +&half; side

Play play aid.

<h3>
<a href="#3.1" id="3.1">3.1 Arts of War </a>

<p>
Each side first draws two random Arts of War cards as Capabilities 
or Events as follows.

<h4>
<a href="#3.1.1" id="3.1.1">3.1.1 Shuffle</a>
</h4>

<p>
Collect and shuffle all unused Teutonic Arts of War 
cards into an Event draw deck; do the same for the Russian player. 
Always include each side's three No Event/No Capability cards. 
Held Events (<a href="#3.1.3">3.1.3</a>) and Capability cards in play (<a href="#3.4.4">3.4.4</a>) are not

<p>
If it is the Levy for the scenario's first 
40 Days, the Teutonic player then the Russian player (<a href="#2.2.4">2.2.4</a>) each

<li>
Place the Lord's starting Forces, Assets (selecting desired

available Vassal Service markers (Coat of Arms up, Ready to 
Muster, <a href="#3.4.2">3.4.2</a>) onto the Lord's mat&mdash;all as shown on the mat. 
Keep aside any Special Vassals that are not available because the

Vassals are not placed on the Lord's mat when the Lord Musters; 
they are available for the Lord to Levy at a later time (<a href="#3.4.2">3.4.2</a>).

<li>
Place the Lord's own Service marker into a 40-Days box on the

<h4>
Vassal Service Advanced Rule
</h4>

<p>
For greater detail, track Vassal Service on the Calendar as 
follows.

<ul>
<li>
Vassals whose Service markers are Coat-of-Arms side down&mdash;
Unready, because they Disbanded this Levy (see below)&mdash;may 
not Muster.

<li>
<mark>
Instead of keeping a Mustering Vassal’s Service marker on
its mat, place it on the Calendar per the Vassal’s Service
Rating (just as for a Lord, <a href="#3.4.1">3.4.1</a>) <u>if</u>
that would put the markerleft of that Lord’s Service marker.
</mark>

<li>
Place a Mustering Vassal's Service marker right of the Levy 
marker by a number of 40-Days boxes equal to the Vassal's 
Service Rating (just as for a Lord, <a href="#3.4.1">3.4.1</a>) and put its Forces 
onto its Lord's mat.

<li>
Whenever a Lord's Service marker is to shift for any reason, 
also shift all his Vassals' Service markers on the Calendar that 
number of boxes in the same direction. Shift Vassal markers 
the specified number of boxes even when the owning Lord's 
marker is already to the left of box 1 or right of box 16. Shift 
Vassal markers left or right off the Calendar in the same manner 
as Lord's markers (<a href="#2.2.3">2.2.3</a>).

<li>
After a side finishes all Vassal Muster for this Levy, flip up 
all Service markers that are Coat-of-Arms side down (<a href="#3.3.2">3.3.2</a>), 
making them Ready for Muster later in the game.
</ul>

<p class="note">
NOTE: If using the Hidden Mats Option (<a href="#1.5.2">1.5.2</a>), the Vassal 
Service advanced rule will nevertheless reveal on the Calendar 
which Vassals Muster.

<ul>
<li>
Each Disband step (<a href="#3.3">3.3</a>, <a href="#4.8.2">4.8.2</a>), permanently remove from play any Vassal markers beyond their Service limit (left of current 40 Days); put Vassal markers that are at Service limit (in the current box) onto their Lord's mat (even if under Siege, <a href="#4.3.5">4.3.5</a>)&mdash;Coat-of-Arms side down (Unready&mdash;they are not available until after the ensuing Muster).

<li>
Return Forces shown on any removed or Disbanding Vassal's 
Service marker from that Lord's mat (to the degree able) to 
the pool. If that leaves the Lord without Forces, Disband him 
(<a href="#1.6">1.6</a>).

<h4>
<a href="#3.4.3" id="3.4.3">3.4.3 Levy Transport</a>

<h4>
<a href="#3.4.4" id="3.4.4">3.4.4 Levy Capabilities</a>

A Lord at a Friendly Locale may obtain 
Capabilities (an Arts of War card's bottom half), either for himself 
or for his entire side (per card text, <a href="#1.9.1">1.9.1</a>), at a cost of one Levy 
action per card selected. Select from any of the side's currently 
unused cards, within these restrictions:

The (lower) Capability section of each Arts of War card shows 
the Coats of Arms of those Lords who can Levy that Capability 
and whom it affects, including "any", "ALL", or "NOT".

<li>
Certain Capabilities refer to"This Lord" . Such Capabilities when 
Levied will affect only the Lord who Levied it. Place the card 
at the bottom edge of that Lord's mat, with the upper half of the 
card (the card's Event) tucked out of view underneath the mat 
as shown in <a href="#1.5.2">1.5.2</a>. A Lord may have at most two "This Lord" 
Capabilities at a time&mdash;the owning player must immediately 
discard any excess. A Lord may not have two of the same named 
Capability (such as T7 and T15, both <var>Warrior Monks</var>.).

<li>
Other Capabilities do not say "This Lord" and affect more than 
a single Lord. Tuck such cards' upper half under the player's 
closest game board edge as shown in table layout (<a href="#2.1.1">2.1.1</a>). A Lord 
may Levy any number of such Capabilities.

<aside class="important">
<b>Important&mdash;</b>A Lord with <mark>two</mark> "This Lord" Capability cards under his mat may Levy more but must immediately discard down to two. A side with more Capabilities at its board edge than Lords on the map discards excess cards at Campaign's start (<a href="#4.0">4.0</a>).

<p>
ARRIVES: If the Legate pawn begins Call to Arms on the <var>William 
of Modena</var> card, the Teutonic player may place the pawn at any 
Bishopric. 

ACTIVE: If <var>William of Modena</var> is in effect and once the Legate 
pawn is on the map, the Teutonic player may as desired use the 
Legate during Call to Arms to either: 

<ul>

<li>
Move the pawn to any Friendly Locale (<a href="#1.3.1">1.3.1</a>), OR
<li>
Use the Legate to do one of the following three things and remove 
the pawn to the <var>William of Modena</var> card when finished&mdash;
<ul>
<li>
If at the Seat of a Ready Lord, Muster that Lord there (<a href="#3.4.1">3.4.1</a>) 
without having to roll, OR
<li>
If at the Seat of a Lord on the Calendar, slide the Lord's cylinder 
by one box left, OR
<li>

Plan: The two sides simultaneously build their Campaign 
Plans&mdash;an ordered stack of Command cards&mdash;and may designate 
Lieutenants to lead other Lords (<a href="#4.1.3">4.1.3</a>).

<li>
Command Activation: Starting with the Teutonic player, 
one side flips its top Command card and executes (if desired) 
Command actions (<a href="#4.2">4.2</a>-<a href="#4.7">4.7</a>) by the Lord on that card or Passes 
back to the other side if a Pass card. 

<ul>
<li>
Actions: One side is Active, using actions to execute 
Commands; the other side is Inactive.
<li>
Feed/Pay/Disband: At the end of each card, both sides Feed 
Forces of Lords who are marked as Moved or Fought, may 
Pay those Lords, then check whether they Disband (<a href="#4.8">4.8</a>).
</ul>

<li>
More Command Activations: The Russian player next flips the 
top Russian card and executes a Russian Command Activation 
as above (actions, Feed). Players continue to alternate Command 
Activations until the Plan stacks are exhausted.

<li>
End Campaign: After both Plan stacks are exhausted and 
Command Activations finished, the Campaign ends. Players 
reset as listed at <a href="#4.9">4.9</a>, advance the Campaign marker to the next 
40-days box, and flip it to Levy. If at the end of the scenario, end

<li>
This Round, the enemy gains a Pursuit advantage against the 
Conceding side's Hits (see below). 

<li>
Place the Pursuit marker between the two sides, pointing from 
the Pursuing to the Conceding side.

</ul>

<p>
REPOSITION: Then, in each Round after the first, both sides 
reposition Lords as follows (in this order).

<ul>

<li>
Rout. Remove Routed Lords from the Battle Array. They
<mark>participate no further until Ending the Battle (<a href="#4.4.3">4.4.3</a>).

<li>
<mark>
Adjust Rows.
If Relief Sally (<a href="#4.4.1">4.4.1</a>) and all of any row Routed,
advance or reface rows: if no Sallying Lords remain, Rearguard
becomes Reserve; if no Rearguard, Sallying Lords Flank Defenders;
if no Front Defenders, Rearguard faces about as Front;
if no Front Attackers, Rearguard becomes Front against Sally (<a href="#4.5.3">4.5.3</a>)
and original Front Defenders face about as Reserve.

<li>
Advance <mark>Lords</mark>. <mark>Attacker then Defender</mark>
slide any Unrouted Lords in Reserve into any empty 
Front positions (one each).

<li>
Center. If a <mark>center</mark> position remains empty, first the Attacker 
then the Defender must select and slide one of that side's Lords 
from either <mark>left or right</mark> to fill its empty <mark>center</mark>
position.

</ul>

STRIKE: The Forces of <mark>each Lord Strikes those</mark> of the 
Lord directly opposite them or&mdash;if Flanking&mdash;<mark>of</mark> the closest 
enemy Lord <mark>in that row</mark>. 

<ul>

<li>
Flanking. Whenever a Lord <mark>facing an enemy row</mark>
has no enemy Lord directly opposite, he <mark>Flanks and</mark>
Strikes the closest <mark>enemy Lord in that row</mark>.
Center <mark>Flanks</mark> left and right <mark>and</mark> chooses <mark>one to strike</mark>.

up.
A Flanking Lord may absorb Hits from <mark>a Lord he Flanks if no enemies Flank the target Lord.</mark>

<li>

letter designates a separate step.
<mark>Within each step, Striking Lords choose the order of Strike, Lord by Lord (or Lord with Flanking Lord[s]). Then any Flanking Lords choose

Forces and Strike type&mdash;see the Forces table. Total all Hits for that 
step, including Flanking plus directly opposing Lords, rounding 
up.
<i class="note">
NOTE: You do not roll to generate Hits - they generate automatically based on the Forces Striking.
</i>

<p>
<img class="square" src="../images/marker_pursuit_russian.png" align="right">

<ul>

<li>
Pursuit. The Conceding side halves 
its total Hits against the Pursuing side. 
Round all fractions up by step. 

</ul>

<p>
APPLY HITS TO LORDS: Hits apply to the Forces of the opposed, 
Flanked, or Flanking enemy Lord. A Player with a Flanking Lord 
<mark>where no enemies are Flanking the target</mark>
selects either the Flanking or directly opposed Lord to take Hits. 
Whenever a Lord Routs to create a new Flanking situation, apply 
remaining Hits accordingly. 

<p>
PROTECTION: Strongholds, Siegeworks, various cards, and most 
Forces types give saving rolls that can nullify Hits&mdash;Walls, Armor, 
Evade, and Unarmored Protection. See the Forces and Strongholds 
tables. Events and Capabilities (<a href="#1.9.1">1.9.1</a>) can change these die-roll 
ranges by adding to or subtracting from the top number of the range. 
See also the No Horseback Archery variant, <a href="#6.0">6.0</a>.

<p class="example">
EXAMPLES: A "+1" to Armor would improve a 1-3 Armor die-roll range to 1-4. A "-1" to Walls would nullify a single Siegeworks marker (<a href="#4.5.2">4.5.2</a>).

<ul>

<li>
Russian Archery. When Russian Archery that reduces enemy Armor Protection (from Garrisons, <a href="#4.5.2">4.5.2</a>, or streltsy, <a href="#1.9.1">1.9.1</a>, <a href="#3.4.4">3.4.4</a>) combines with other Archery, round up any &half; Hits that cause the reduction.
<i class="example">
EXAMPLE: Three <var>Streltsy</var> Men-at-Arms and three Asiatic Horse would yield a total of three Hits, of which two cause -2 Armor.  
</i>

</ul>

<p>
<img class="square" src="../images/marker_walls.a.png" align="right">

<p>
ROLL WALLS: If this is a Storm or Sally (<a href="#4.5.2">4.5.2</a>-.3) 
or as provided by Event (<a href="#1.9.1">1.9.1</a>, <a href="#3.1.3">3.1.3</a>), a Lord benefiting from any Walls or Siege markers first rolls dice 
equal to the total number of Hits just received in that 
step before assigning any Hits to his units. Each roll within the 
Walls range specified (for example, "1-2") or less than or equal to 
the total Siege markers cancels one of those Hits. 

<p>
ASSIGN HITS TO UNITS: After rolling for any Walls, the owner 
selects which unit will absorb each Hit, Hit by Hit. Each Hit causes 
a Protection die roll and Routs that unit if it fails the roll, or automatically Routs a Serf unit. 

<aside class="important">
<b>Important&mdash;</b>A unit may absorb several Hits in succession, shielding its fellow units, as long as it succeeds on each Protection roll.
</aside>

<p>
ROLL BY HIT: Units roll Protection as follows.

<ul>

<li>
Armor. A unit with any Armor Protection assigned a Hit rolls a 
die. A roll within the Armor range specified (on the Forces table 
and/or by card, <a href="#1.9.1">1.9.1</a>) means that Hit has no effect (no Rout).

<li>
Evade. Units with Evade Protection roll and absorb Hits just as 
if Armored, except that Evade is not used against Archery Hits 
nor Hits in Storm (<a href="#4.5.2">4.5.2</a>). 

<li>
Unarmored. Non-Serf units without Armor or Evade (or when 
Evade does not apply) instead avoid Routing on a Hit only on a 
roll of 1.

<li>
Serfs. Serfs never roll Protection by unit; remove them whenever 
assigned a Hit. 

</ul>

<p>
ROUT: A unit is Routed as soon as it fails to negate a Hit with a 
successful Protection roll. Slide each Routed unit to the "Routed" 
section of the Lord's mat. Routed units no longer Strike nor absorb 
Hits in that Battle. 

<ul>

<li>
A Lord Routs at the moment that his last Unrouted unit Routs. 
Remove him from the Array. A new Flanking situation may 
immediately result <mark>among Lords facing each other.
When an entire row Routs, ignore remaining Hits against that row.</mark>

</ul>

<p>
NEW ROUND: If neither side Conceded and at least one Lord on 
each side has yet to Rout, begin a new Round with the "Concede 
the Field?" step (above); otherwise end per below.

<h4>
<a href="#4.4.3" id="4.4.3">4.4.3 Ending the Battle</a>

<p>
A side that Conceded at the start of the 
Round or that has no Unrouted Lords when the other side did not 
Concede loses the Battle at the end of that Round. Proceed thus:

<p>
RETREAT, WITHDRAWAL, OR REMOVAL: All losing Lords 
must either&mdash; 

<ul>

<li>
Retreat to a single adjacent Locale that has no Unbesieged enemy 
Lords or Strongholds, OR 

<li>
Withdraw into that side's Stronghold at the Battle Locale (if it

<li>
Be permanently removed (<a href="#1.5.1">1.5.1</a>).

<p>
LOSSES: Both sides check for removal of Routed Forces per <a href="#4.4.4">4.4.4</a> below.

SPOILS: Lords on the losing side of a Battle may have to immediately transfer Assets to Lords on the winning side; the winning 
player distributes these Assets among mats of Lords at the Locale&mdash;

<ul>

<li>
Losing Lords who were Removed (by Losses or for being unable 
to Retreat or Withdraw) or who Retreated without having 
Conceded the Field (<a href="#4.4.2">4.4.2</a>-.3) transfer all their Assets except 
Ships.

<li>
Lords who Conceded and Retreated transfer all Loot and any 
Provender beyond that which they could take along the Retreat 
Way without being Laden (<a href="#4.3.2">4.3.2</a>) but lose no other Assets. 

<li>
Lords who Withdrew keep all their Assets.

SERVICE: The losing side rolls one die for each of its Retreated 
Lords and shifts that Lord's Service marker (and, if using the advanced Vassal Service rule, <a href="#3.4.2">3.4.2</a>, each of his Vassals' markers) left

<ul>

<li>
Roll a die for each Routed unit. 

<li>
For units of Lords who Retreated without having Conceded the 
Field (<a href="#4.4.2">4.4.2</a>-.3), remove all Routed units that fail to roll a "1".

<li>
For all other Lords, compare each unit's roll to its inherent Armor, 
Evasion, or Unarmored Protection. Use the Protection roll range 
shown on the Forces table for that type, unmodified by Events, 
Capabilities, or Battle/Storm situation. Asiatic Horse always use 
its Evade range. 

<li>
Push Routed units that roll within these ranges above the line on 
their Lord's mat&mdash;they are no longer Routed. Remove Routed 
units that fail their roll to the pool. (Service markers stay put.)

all his Forces in Battle or Storm.

<p>
Lords at Siege Locales (<a href="#4.3.5">4.3.5</a>) may take actions to advance the 
Siege or to Storm or Sally (Attack).

<h4>
<a href="#4.5.1" id="4.5.1">4.5.1 Siege</a>
</h4>

<p>
Any Besieging Lord may use all actions of his Command card to advance the Siege in the following order. 

<p>
SURRENDER? If the Siege Locale has no Besieged Lords, the 
Besieging side may roll for Surrender. A die roll less than or equal 
to the number of Siege markers there results in Conquest of the 
Stronghold via Surrender, as follows&mdash;

<ul>

<li>
Remove Siege markers. Place Conquered marker(s) (per type, <a href="#1.3.1">1.3.1</a>) at the Stronghold or remove any Conquered marker(s) already there. If there is a Castle marker (<a href="#1.8">1.8</a>, <a href="#1.9.1">1.9.1</a> STONEMASONS), flip it. If Novgorod, remove all Veche Coin (<a href="#1.3.3">1.3.3</a>). Adjust VP (<a href="#2.2.5">2.2.5</a>, <a href="#5.1">5.1</a>).

<li>
Terms: A Stronghold Conquered by Siege Surrender provides 
no Spoils (<a href="#4.5.2">4.5.2</a>).

</ul>

<img class="square" src="../images/marker_siege_russian.png" align="right">
<img class="square" src="../images/marker_siege_teutonic.png" align="right">
 
<p>
SIEGEWORKS: If the Stronghold did 
not Surrender (including because the 
Besieger declined to roll), and if the 
Besieging side has at least as many Lords 
there as the Stronghold's Siege Capacity (1, 2, or 3), add one 
Siege marker, to a maximum of four markers at the Locale.

Any Lord outside a Besieged Stronghold may use a Command action to launch an Attack. 
Proceed per Battle rules (<a href="#4.4">4.4</a>) except as follows; 
refer to the Battles and Storm chart.
<i class="note">
NOTE: Some Events and Capabilities apply to Battle but not to Storm, or the reverse.
</i>

<p>
ARRAY: Unlike in Battle, each side's Front row holds at most one 
Lord, beginning for the Attacker with the Active Lord; other Lords 
must start in Reserve.

<p>
<img class="big" src="images/storm_array.png">
<br>
Storm Array: Teutons are Storming a Russian Lord who is Besieged 
in a Fort (Capacity 1).

<p>
CONCEDE? At the start of each Round, the Attacker (only) may 
end the Storm then. The Attacker loses. Go to Ending the Storm 
below.

<p>
REPOSITION: Unlike in Battle, in each Round after the first, 
Attacker then Defender may switch positions between their Front 
and any Reserve Lord.

<p>
STRONGHOLD EFFECTS:

<ul>

<li>
The Besieged side receives 
<mark>the Garrison units shown for that type of Stronghold on the Strongholds table</mark>
(one-to-three Men-at-Arms units and sometimes a Knights <mark>unit</mark>).

<li>
The Besieged side uses that Stronghold's Walls (<a href="#4.4.2">4.4.2</a> and the 
Strongholds table). 

<li>
The Besieging side uses Siegeworks as its own Walls (see below).

<li>
All Defending units Melee Strike before any Attacking units do, 
unlike Battle in which Horse Melee precedes Foot (<a href="#4.4.2">4.4.2</a>, see the 
Battle and Storm chart).

<li>
The Attacking side must absorb Hits with any Armored units 
before doing so with other units.

<li>
<mark>
Each Lord of each side in Storm adds no more than <u>six</u> Hits in Melee. (Archery is unlimited.)

</ul>

<p>
GARRISONS: Certain added units as shown on the Strongholds 
chart help Defend during Storm. 

<p>
GARRISON FORCES DURING STORM: 

<ul>

<li>
Garrison Men-at-Arms (not Knights) have both Melee and 
Archery. Enemy Armor Protection is -2 against their Archery 
Hits (as if with a Crossbowmen Capability).

<li>
Garrisons add their Strikes to those of the Defending Lord 
(rounding up), if any, but do not otherwise affect the Lord's 
Strikes. Garrisons are separate from any Defending Lord and 
ignore cards affecting that Lord individually.
<i class="example">
EXAMPLES: A Besieged Teutonic Lord's units get Archery only via a <var>Balistarii</var> Capability card; his <var>Halbbrüder</var> would not affect Garrison Armor. 
</i>

<li>
The Defender must assign all Hits suffered to Garrison units 
until they are Routed, after which Defending Front Lord's units 
absorb Hits. 

<li>
Whenever Routed and at the end of the Storm, return Garrison 
units to the pool.

<li>
The full complement of Garrison units Defend in each enemy 
Storm action, regardless of what may have happened in previous 
Storm actions.

</ul>

<p>
SIEGEWORKS: The Besieging side places all Siege markers at 
the Locale in front of its Attacking Lord(s). Those Lords during the 
Storm have Walls with value equal to the number of Siege markers 
against both Archery and Melee Strikes. 

<p class="example">
EXAMPLE: Lords Storming with three Siege markers would benefit from Walls 1-3.

<p>
ENDING THE STORM: A Storm ends once the number of Rounds 
completed equals the number of Siege markers there, or earlier if a 
side loses because all its <mark>Forces</mark> there Rout or the Attacker Concedes.

<ul>

<li>
Unless the Defenders all Routed, the Attackers lose. Losing 
Attackers neither Retreat nor give up Spoils. Presuming that 
Attackers survive, the Locale remains Besieged&mdash;return the 
Siege markers to the map and go to Aftermath (<a href="#4.4.5">4.4.5</a>).

<li>
If the Defenders lose, the Stronghold is Sacked as below. 

<li>
Both sides' Forces take Losses per Battle (<a href="#4.4.4">4.4.4</a>), except that 
Routed Defending units always roll against Protection and 
Routed Attacking units that fail to roll a "1" are removed.

<li>
Mark all Lords there as Moved/Fought, even Lords who remained in Reserve.
<i class="note">
NOTE: Lords at a Storm Locale may not simply sit it out. Whether used or not, they were available for action and will end up marked Moved/Fought.
</i>

</ul>

<p>
SACK: When Besieged Defenders lose a Storm&mdash;

<ul>

<li>
Permanently remove all losing Lords (<a href="#1.5.1">1.5.1</a>) and award Spoils 
from them (all of their Assets except Ships, <a href="#4.4.3">4.4.3</a>). 

<li>
The Besiegers Conquer the Stronghold. Place or remove 
Conquered markers (<a href="#1.3.1">1.3.1</a>) and adjust the appropriate VP marker 
on the Calendar (<a href="#2.2.5">2.2.5</a>, <a href="#5.1">5.1</a>). Remove Siege markers.

<li>
Award Spoils from the Stronghold. The Besiegers receive and 
distribute as desired among their Lords' mats a number of Loot, 
Provender, and Coin each equal to the Stronghold's VP (<a href="#1.3.1">1.3.1</a>, 
Strongholds table). If Teutonic Lords Sack Novgorod, also award 
them all Veche Coin as Spoils (<a href="#1.3.3">1.3.3</a>).

<p class="example">
EXAMPLE: Sacking a City yields two Loot, two Provender, and two Coin.

not receive any Walls or Garrison (<a href="#4.5.2">4.5.2</a>). The Defenders receive 
Siegeworks as if Storming (<a href="#4.5.2">4.5.2</a>). Losing Defenders Retreat normally, ending the Siege. Losing Attackers must Withdraw back 
into their Stronghold (<a href="#4.4.3">4.4.3</a>, not Retreat).

<h3>
<a href="#4.6" id="4.6">4.6 Supply</a>

Supply Route is an unbroken chain of Locales and Ways between 
the Active Lord and a Source, served by Transport.

<ul>

<li>
A Supply Route may not enter a Locale with the enemy's Lord,

Arts of War decks and drawing random Capabilities (<a href="#3.1.1">3.1.1</a>-<a href="#3.1.2">3.1.2</a>).

<p>
<mark>
BIDDING FOR SIDES:
If preferred for balance, after choosing a scenario but before assigning sides,
bid to play the Russians. Players each put zero, one, or more dice under a
cupped hand. Reveal simultaneously: total pips showing is the bid. The player
with the lower bid takes the Russians and adds 1VP markers equal in number to
that bid to the Veche box (adjust Victory). If bids tied, add that number of
1VP markers and assign sides randomly.

<h4>
No Horseback Archery
</h4>

<p>
Russian muster for the 1240-1242 conflict of archers who shot 
from moving horses is historically disputable. See the Background booklet, Arts of War, Russian Capability #R10 <var>Steppe 
Warriors</var> History. To leave them out: 

<ul>
<li>
Ignore Evade Defense. Asiatic Horse units' Defense 
rolls instead always succeed only on "1", just as for other 
Unarmored units.
</ul>

<aside class="note">
DESIGN NOTE: With this option, Asiatic Horse represent archers who ride to battle but fight dismounted or at a halt rather than steppe warriors or Russians fighting in the Asiatic style.

Return of the Prince -
1241 to 1242
</h3>

<p>
With the Teutons settling into Rus and their raids almost reaching 
the great city, Novgorodans and the Grand Prince at last see eye-to-eye on a response.

<p>
Seasons: This is a longer scenario (eight 40-Day periods)&mdash;the

<h3>
Return of the Prince -
Nicolle Variant
</h3>

<p>
In contrast to the Novgorod Chronicle, David Nicolle in Lake 
Peipus 1242 (Osprey) dates the Teutonic assault on Pskov to 1241 
rather than 1240, with the Teutons pressing south of Lake Chud 
while Aleksandr counterattacks in the north.

<p>
Seasons: This is another longer scenario (up to eight 40-Day 
periods)&mdash;a different interpretation of the timing of the Teutonic 
invasions. Begin with Levy of Summer 1241 (40-Days box 9) and

<h3>
Peipus - 1242
</h3>

<p>
Rather than pressing the Danes westward from his reconquest of 
Koporye, Aleksandr bolsters his army to liberate Pskov and wreak 
revenge on Dorpat. 

<p>
Seasons: This is a mid-length scenario (up to four 40-Day periods)

<h3>
Crusade on Novgorod - 1240 to 1242
</h3>

<p>
With Aleksandr's repulse of the Swedes, the Veche feels safe to 
dismiss its Prince and let Novgorod see to its own defense. But 
over the lakes, reconciled Teutonic knights and Danes now eye 
Rus as a prize.

<p>
Seasons: This is the full-length scenario&mdash;the German and Danish 
invasions and Nevsky's riposte. Begin with Levy of Summer 1240
